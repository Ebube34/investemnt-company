              Albert Einstein is said to have once remarked that the most potent
              force in the universe is the principle of compounding. In the
              realm of investing and finance, this force is evident in the
              concept of compounding returns. In simpler terms, compound
              interest entails earning interest on the interest you've already
              received, leading to a rapid multiplication of your funds.
              <div style={{ margin: "1.5rem 0" }} />
              To illustrate, if you start with $500 and accrue 10% interest
              annually, you'll have $550 after the first year. Subsequently,
              earning 10% interest on the new amount of $550 the following year
              results in a total of $605 by the end of the second year. This
              cycle continues until, eventually, the interest gained may surpass
              your initial $500.
              <div style={{ margin: "1.5rem 0" }} />
              This strategy is a key factor in the success of many accomplished
              investors in growing their wealth. Importantly, it's not exclusive
              to top investors—anyone can leverage compound interest through
              savings accounts and investment portfolios. Discover how to

            Compound Interest and the Time Value of Money
          </h1>
          <p style={{ padding: "2rem 0" }} className={styles.paragraph}>
            The foundation underlying compound interest is rooted in the concept
            of the time value of money, which posits that the worth of money
            fluctuates based on when it is received. Having $100 today is more
            advantageous than receiving it in a few years, as it can be invested
            to generate dividends and interest income. Compounding facilitates
            the growth of that money. If you were to delay receiving that $100
            by two years, you would forego two years of potential compound
            interest, and this is referred to as opportunity cost.
            <div style={{ margin: "1.5rem 0" }} />
            Opportunity cost represents the missed gains if a particular course
            of action is not chosen. In this scenario, the opportunity cost
            equates to the amount of money foregone in interest by not investing
            that sum.
            <div style={{ margin: "1.5rem 0" }} />
            Using our earlier example, if you choose not to invest the $500 in
            an account with a 10% annual interest rate, you would miss the
            chance to earn $50 or more annually in interest. Over 10 years, your
            $500 could potentially grow to $1,296.87. However, without
            investment, it would remain $500 after the same 10-year period.

            Here's another example: Let's say you are 30 years old and want to

            How Compound Interest Could Impact Teens and Their Savings
          </h1>
          <p style={{ padding: "2rem 0" }} className={styles.paragraph}>
            Your adolescent years present an opportune moment to initiate
            savings for the future. The advantage lies in the ample time
            available for your money to accumulate before potential needs such
            as purchasing a house or retiring arise, allowing you to reap
            significant benefits from compound interest. An effortless approach
            to kickstart the process is by opening a high-yield savings account
            and making consistent monthly contributions. While the interest
            earned in a savings account might be modest, the cumulative effect
            of compound interest can be substantial over time. To illustrate,
            contributing $50 monthly to a high-yield savings account with a 0.5%
            annual interest rate could yield over $12,000 after 20 years.
            <div style={{ margin: "1.5rem 0" }} />
            Once you have established a savings routine, you may explore the
            realm of investing to potentially maximize the advantages of
            compound interest further. For instance, suppose you initiate an
            investment account with the guidance of an adult (typically
            requiring an age of 18 or older to invest). Contributing $100 per
            month to the investment account over 40 years, with a 10% annual
            rate of return on investment, could result in your money growing to
            exceed $530,000.

            A Higher Rate of Return Often Comes With More Risk
          </h1>
          <p style={{ padding: "2rem 0" }} className={styles.paragraph}>
            While the desire for a higher rate of return on your savings or
            investments may be compelling, it's important to recognize the
            associated risks, as elevated returns often come with increased
            potential for danger. Regardless of your success in this pursuit,
            it's crucial to steer clear of the possibility of losing more than a
            predetermined portion of your invested funds.
            <div style={{ margin: "1.5rem 0" }} />
            To mitigate risk, it's advisable to carefully assess all available
            investment options. Initiating with a high-yield savings account can
            provide a steady and respectable interest accrual over the years.
            Additionally, certificates of deposits (CDs) and money market
            accounts present opportunities for earning interest on your capital.
            Exploring diverse investment avenues such as stocks, bonds,
            exchange-traded funds (ETFs), index funds, and mutual funds further
            contributes to risk diversification. By incorporating a range of
            investments into your portfolio, you not only mitigate potential
            risks but also harness the wealth-building potential of compound
            interest.

              Compound interest refers to the accumulation of interest on the
              initial principal amount, taking into account the interest already
              earned. To illustrate, suppose you begin with $100 and earn a 10%
              interest rate in the first year, resulting in a total of $110. If,
              in the second year, you earn 10% interest on the new total of
              $110, your final amount would be $121. The additional $11 in the
              second year is attributed to compound interest, as it stems from
              applying interest to both the original principal and the interest
              earned in the initial year.

              Calculating compound interest is straightforward using a compound
              interest calculator. However, if you prefer a manual approach,
              follow this formula: Multiply your annual interest rate by your
              initial principal value, then add the result to the initial
              principal value. This sum becomes your new principal value. Repeat
              this process. For instance, if your annual interest rate is 10%,
              then 10% of $100 is $10. Adding this to the initial $100 gives you
              a new principal balance of $110.

              You can get compound interest by opening a financial account that
              offers some sort of annual rate of return. For example, you could
              open a savings account with an APY of 0.5% and contribute money to
              it every month to get compound interest and grow your money.

              Simple interest is computed solely based on the initial principal
              amount, whereas compound interest takes into account both the
              principal and any interest previously accrued. For instance,
              earning 10% on a $100 principal balance annually results in simple
              interest. However, if the 10% interest is applied to the updated
              balance each year ($100 in year one, $110 in year two, and so on),
              then compound interest is being earned.
